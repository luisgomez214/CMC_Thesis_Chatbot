![deploy](https://github.com/luisgomez214/CMC_Thesis_Chatbot/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

An interactive RAG-based chatbot that helps students, researchers, and faculty explore Claremont McKenna College senior theses. [cmcthesischatbot.com](https://cmcthesischatbot.com)

## Overview

Built as a senior thesis project, this system combines Groq's LLM with a structured SQLite database to provide intelligent, thesis-specific answers. It supports search, analysis, and brainstorming based on metadata from CMCâ€™s thesis archive (through Fall 2024).

**Data Collection**  
- CSVs sourced from [Scholarship@Claremont](https://scholarship.claremont.edu)  
- Cleaned, merged, and indexed into `theses.db` with FTS5

**Architecture (RAG)**  
- **Retrieve**: Matches user query to thesis data (title, author, department, etc.)  
- **Augment**: Adds metadata to the prompt  
- **Generate**: Groq LLM crafts accurate, natural responses  
- **Format**: Returns structured, markdown-friendly output  
- (Specifically: The LLM reads the prompt, generates SQL queries, executes them, and formulates the final answer.)

**Deployment**  
- Flask backend + Docker  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Deployed on AWS EC2 with secure HTTPS (Route 53 + ACM)

**Features**  
- Search by title, author, advisor, department, or keyword  
- Run analytical queries (e.g., "How many Economics theses in 2020?")  
- Get thesis ideas with outlines and advisor suggestions  
- Summarize or explain thesis abstracts  
- Explore advisor expertise
