The purpose of this thesis is to show how to create a chatbot for whatever topic that anyone may be interested in by creating a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generations) system.
It is to be interpreted as a general guide.

**Background:**

In recent years, there has been an increase of interest in artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM) and its capabilities.
AI is the field that develops intelligent machines and LLM is a type of AI that is focused on understanding and communicating with humans.
Innovations such as ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, or any of the many other language models, artificial intelligence is dominating almost every market.
With the rise of AI comes opportunities and issues.
For starters, people who do not keep up with current technology trends may not fully understand the capabilities of LLM.
They may understand the basics, how to use GPT-4 ChatGPT for school or work.
However, there is much that can be learned and done with LLM that will help companies.
This is something that many developers are aware about.
This has given rise to many AI based startups whose goal is to help solve a problem using AI and LLM.
These companies target other companies and the general public with the promise that their AI is revolutionary and will improve productivity.

There are many benefits of using AI and they mainly revolve around time.
AI allows for automation, reducing the time it takes to complete manual tasks that face the possibility of human error.
Humans make mistakes, sometimes due to bad decision making or because of a simple mistake, LLM helps prevent these mistakes.
Since the decisions made by LLM are data driven, you can ensure that it won't make uniformed decisions.
They are also engaging, allowing for intuitive responses and usage.
When chatting with a LLM, it feels like you are chatting with an actual human.
However, this human is available 24/7, has scalability, and doesn't have any human limitations.
There are many sectors where AI can be used and there is much technology to still be developed.
This will only make our task more efficient.

Though there are many benefits of AI, it does come with its disadvantages.
For starters, because the database is so large, it is bound to make mistakes.
The LLM may not always interpret the text correctly or it may get confused and provide an incorrect answer, which can lead to people being misinformed.
Another disadvantage is that it is reliant on the internet, so without it, it is useless unless run locally.
Because the training data is based on the data found online, it can lead to bias.
Since this technology can do the work for many humans, ethical concerns arise.
Technology could potentially advance to the point that it is replacing our jobs.
Not to mention the privacy concerns, security, and energy consumption that comes with AI use.
Finally, there is also limited transparency, meaning that the AI can't explain how or why it made certain decisions.
Though not all these issues may be solved, a RAG system can combat some of these concerns.

These services, applications, and software are costly.
The reason these companies and developers charge so much is because their services address the issues that LLM have and the solutions to these issues are not common knowledge to many.
The training data that the LLM is based off of is out of date.
AI models like ChatGPT, Groq, and Claude, only know up until they were last updated.
Meaning that if the data is only up until 2024, it will not know about nor answer over information that happened after.
These developers implement the AI’s LLM by updating it with the information or data they need.
Doing so allows for the data to be customizable while also reducing hallucinates.
This means that the AI can be case specific while also increasing its accuracy.
For example, an AI based startup may decide to create an app that can help patients in healthcare.
The app is an interactive chatbot that allows the user to ask user specific questions about their medical information.
This in theory is revolutionary as if it's done correctly, it can replace the jobs of pharmacists and receptionists, saving companies money in the long run.
Essentially, AI is an investment.

**RAG:**

A RAG system is an AI architecture that improves the system by specifying the database.
The system first retrieves the correct information from a specific database based on the user prompt.
It then generates an answer using a LLM.
It is the same as giving ChatGPT your entire assignment and asking it questions regarding the assignment but at a larger, automated scale.
By giving the LLM a specified database, it is able to focus on the data and provide better answers.
If the training data for the LLM is outdated, this is a way of updating it.
If the system and LLM are run locally, then you can avoid sending sensitive information to the API’s of the LLM.
This is difficult to do as it would have to be developed without connecting to the internet and the API.
A RAG system is a way that companies and the general public can use AI for their personal needs.
