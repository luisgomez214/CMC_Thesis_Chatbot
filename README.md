# CMC Thesis Chatbot

An interactive RAG-based chatbot that helps students, researchers, and faculty explore Claremont McKenna College senior theses.

## Overview

Built as a senior thesis project, this system combines Groq's LLM with a structured SQLite database to provide intelligent, thesis-specific answers. It supports search, analysis, and brainstorming based on metadata from CMCâ€™s thesis archive (through Fall 2024).
 

1. **Data Collection**  
   - CSVs sourced from [Scholarship@Claremont](https://scholarship.claremont.edu)  
   - Cleaned, merged, and indexed into `theses.db` with FTS5

2. **Architecture (RAG)**  
   - **Retrieve**: Matches user query to thesis data (title, author, department, etc.)  
   - **Augment**: Adds metadata to the prompt  
   - **Generate**: Groq LLM crafts accurate, natural responses  
   - **Format**: Returns structured, markdown-friendly output
(Specifically the LLM reads the prompt, makes SQL queries based on the prompt to run, and based on the outputs gives the user their answer)

3. **Deployment**  
   - Flask backend + Docker  
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
   - Deployed on AWS EC2 with secure HTTPS via Route 53 + ACM

## Comparison With CHATGPT4o

### Get Thesis Ideas / Outline
![Screenshot of Outline](screenshots/check1.png)

Gives ideas not based on current thesis metadata. This could lead to repeated ideas.

### Advisor Search

Gives information over thesis/papers not in the metadata and from another source.


### Thesis Search

Both systems can summarize papers but ChatGPT cant have access to all thesis like my system.
Adding the actual paper icontent to the metadata will ensure better summarize.

## Future Development Roadmap

- Enhanced query handling with fuzzy matching and spell correction
- Add more to metadata
- Responsive UI design for improved mobile experience
- User authentication for personalized session history
- Production-grade WSGI implementation (NGINX + Gunicorn)
