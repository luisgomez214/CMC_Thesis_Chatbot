In recent years, there has been an increase of interest in artificial intelligence (AI), 
large language models (LLM), and its capabilities. AI is the field that develops intelligent 
machines, and LLM is a type of AI that is focused on understanding and communicating with 
humans. Innovations such as ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, or any of the many other language 
models show that artificial intelligence is dominating almost every market.With the rise of AI comes opportunities and issues. For starters, people who do not keep up 
with current technology trends may not fully understand the capabilities of LLM. They may 
understand the basics, like how to use GPT-4 ChatGPT for school or work. However, there is 
much that can be learned and done with LLM that will help companies. This is something that 
many developers are aware of. This has given rise to many AI-based startups whose goal is to 
solve problems using AI and LLM.

The costs for these services, applications, and software are expensive. The reason these 
companies and developers charge so much is because their services address issues that LLMs 
have, and the solutions to these issues are not common knowledge. The training data that LLMs 
are based on is often out of date. AI models like ChatGPT, Groq, and Claude only know up until 
the time they were last updated. This means that if the data is only up until 2024, it will 
not know or answer information that happened afterward. These developers implement AI's LLM by updating it with the information or data they need. 
Doing so allows for the data to be customizable while also reducing hallucinations. This 
means that the AI can be case-specific while also increasing its accuracy. For example, an AI-based startup may decide to create an app that helps patients in healthcare. 
The app is an interactive chatbot that allows users to ask specific questions about their 
medical information. In theory, this is revolutionary. If done correctly, it can replace the 
jobs of pharmacists and receptionists, saving companies money in the long run. Essentially, 
AI is an investment.

There are many benefits of using AI, and most of them revolve around time. AI allows for 
automation, reducing the time it takes to complete manual tasks that are prone to human error. 
Humans make mistakesâ€”sometimes due to bad decision-making, or simply by accident. LLM helps 
prevent these mistakes. They are also engaging, allowing for intuitive responses and usage. 
There are many sectors where AI can be used, and much technology is still to be developed. 
This will only make our tasks more efficient.
