# 🎓 CMC Thesis Chatbot

Welcome to the **CMC Thesis Chatbot** — a smart, interactive chatbot designed to help you explore senior theses from Claremont McKenna College using the power of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system backed by **Groq's LLM**.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project was built to help students, researchers, and faculty quickly **search**, **analyze**, and **brainstorm** based on Claremont McKenna College’s senior thesis archive (up to **Fall 2024**).

---

## 📥 Data Collection & Preparation

- The thesis data was sourced directly from the [Claremont Colleges Library’s institutional repository](https://scholarship.claremont.edu).
- I downloaded and **merged multiple CSV datasets** to create a comprehensive file of all CMC theses.
- The data was cleaned to standardize column formats, remove duplicates, and fill missing entries.
- I then loaded the cleaned data into a **SQLite database (`theses.db`)**, and built **indexes** and **FTS5 full-text search** tables to allow fast, flexible retrieval.

## 🧠 What is a RAG System?

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It's an AI architecture that combines two powerful techniques:

1. **Retrieval**: Find relevant context (e.g. thesis titles, keywords, abstracts, advisors) from a structured database.
2. **Augmented Generation**: Use a **Large Language Model (LLM)** — in this case, **Groq's LLM** — to generate intelligent, grounded answers using the retrieved data.

This ensures the chatbot doesn’t just hallucinate information — it responds based on real thesis records.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** for backend logic
- **Flask** for the web server and routing
- **SQLite** + **FTS5** for fast thesis queries
- **Groq LLM API** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Docker + Docker Compose** for containerized deployment
- **AWS EC2** for hosting
- **Route 53** + **SSL Certificate Manager** to map a secure HTTPS domain:

## 🚢 Deployment

### Hosted on:

- **AWS EC2** instance running Docker Compose
- Custom domain (`cmcthesischatbot.com`) set up using **AWS Route 53**
- HTTPS secured with **TLS certificates** via AWS

### CI/CD

The deployment is automated using a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### What `deploy.yml` does:

1. Checks out the repo on push to `main`
2. Installs dependencies: Python, Docker, Docker Compose
3. Builds the Docker container using `docker-compose build`
4. Authenticates with AWS using GitHub secrets
5. (Optional) Initializes the Elastic Beanstalk environment
6. Deploys the latest version using `eb deploy`

## 🧠 Improvements & Future Work

- Handle edge cases more gracefully (e.g., typos, fuzzy matching)
- Improve UI styling and add responsive design for mobile
- Expand scope to include other Claremont Colleges
- Add login feature for personalized session history
- Improve LLM prompting for more focused answers
- Integrate BibTeX export or citations
- Convert to production WSGI stack (e.g., NGINX + Gunicorn)
