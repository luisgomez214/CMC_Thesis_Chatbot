	In recent years, there has been an increase of interest in artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM) and its capabilities. AI is the field that develops intelligent machines and LLM is a type of AI that is focused on understanding and communicating with humans. Innovations such as ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, or any of the many other language models, artificial intelligence is dominating almost every market. With the rise of AI comes opportunities and issues. For starters, people who do not keep up with current technology trends may not fully understand the capabilities of LLM. They may understand the basics, how to use GPT-4 ChatGPT for school or work. However, there is much that can be learned and done with LLM that will help companies. This is something that many developers are aware about. This has given rise to many AI based startups whose goal is to help solve a problem using AI and LLM. 
The costs for these services, applications, and software are expensive. The reason these companies and developers charge so much is because their services address the issues that LLM have and the solutions to these issues are not common knowledge to many. The training data that the LLM is based off of is out of date. AI models like ChatGPT, Groq, and Claude, only know up until they were last updated. Meaning that if the data is only up until 2024, it will not know about nor answer over information that happened after. These developers implement the AIâ€™s LLM by updating it with the information or data they need. Doing so allows for the data to be customizable while also reducing hallucinates. This means that the AI can be case specific while also increasing its accuracy. For example, an AI based startup may decide to create an app that can help patients in healthcare. The app is an interactive chatbot that allows the user to ask user specific questions about their medical information. This in theory is revolutionary as if it's done correctly, it can replace the jobs of pharmacists and receptionists, saving companies money in the long run. Essentially, AI is an investment. 
There are many benefits of using AI and it mainly revolves around time. AI allows for automation, reducing the time it takes to complete manual tasks that face the possibility of human error. Humans make mistakes, sometimes due to bad decision making or because of a simple mistake, LLM helps prevent these mistakes. They are also engaging, allowing for intuitive responses and usage. There are many sectors where AI can be used and there is much technology to still be developed. This will only make our task more efficient.
